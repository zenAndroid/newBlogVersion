            <h1 id="posttitle">On Competence, and the coming
                year</h1>

            <p>Hey, we are in the year 2020 now.</p>
            <p>I’ve made an earlier version of this post that i kept
                editing and re-editing multiple times before i deleted it
                altogether because i thought it was too cheesy and i
                couldn’t express my idea well enough.</p>
            <p>But I’m going to try again, i don’t know if I’ll succeed
                this time around, but I’ll try nevertheless.</p>

                resolutions useful ?</h1>
            <p>I don’t know and i don’t care.</p>
            <h1 id="my-tentative-resolutions">My tentative
                resolutions</h1>
            <p>Here is a vague list of my resolutions for this year</p>
            <ul>
                <li>BrainFood :: <a href="https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/">Structure and
                        Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>, <a href="https://haskellbook.com/">Haskell programming
                        from
                        first principles</a>, and custom/miscellaneous math (just
                    eat those math textbooks, man).</li>
                <li>Read books (This is kind of an unnecessary list item
                    because it’s kind of … Natural to me)</li>
                <li>Write/Outline more often. (It’s (partly) why you got
                    that mechanical keyboard <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
                        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, after
                    all)</li>
                <li>Update blog more often.</li>
                <li>GYM, JUST DO IT. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
                </li>
                <li>NO SUGAR, CUT OUT SUGAR FROM YOUR DIET.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But coming up with that list wasn’t as easy as i thought
                at first, because you see, there are a load of other cool
                technologies that i want to learn: - I know the basics of C,
                but i would like to deepen my knowledge of it and delve
                deeper into making some high level applications using it
                just to challenge myself and learn through it. - I also know
                the basics of C++, but same thing, would like to learn the
                secrets of the Standard Template Library, and also BOOST my
                knowledge regarding a huge C++ library ;) - The Go
                programming language intrigues me, and i keep hearing good
                stuff about it <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>,
                would like
                to learn it. - Rust seems interesting, I want to see what it
                can do, SAME GOES FOR GO because they seem like they’re
                being advertised as high-level languages that offer some
                capabilities for low level <em>FAST</em> control <strong>and
                    i want to learn this skill</strong> - There are some
                fundamental CS concepts I’m not so familiar with like
                asynchronous stuff and <code>Future</code>s or
                <code>Promise</code>s ?<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
                    role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> - Javascript
                ? Typescript ? Vue ? React ? <strong><em>A N G U L A R
                        ???</em></strong>, NODEJS, etc… What are these things and
                how do they work ?<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> -
                PyQt5,
                seems like a decent tool to have in your tool set, also
                IPython, JUPYTER, etc … - I have to improve my python skills
                the same way i said for C/C++. - Java, you may have heard of
                it … You kinda … Need to at least improve it a bit i
                guess.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> - Well, <em>to
                    put it
                    lightly</em> <strong><em>i dislike</em></strong> Java just a
                teeny tiny bit, but there are these things that claim to be
                able to solve a lot of headaches and that are completely JVM
                compatible, like: - Kotlin, they say it’s for android ? -
                Scala, this one seems like, <em>really</em> interesting, i
                think you should drop everything you’re planning to do and
                learn this, claims to be able to support OOP, FP,
                <em>and</em> some other niceties ? <strong>SIGN ME UP
                    !</strong> - Clojure, a java-compatible lisp ? Sign me up !
                - Erlang, Elixir, F#, C#, etc … - Game development, Unreal
                engine, Unity, etc … - Other things i will be adding as i
                remember them.
            </p>
            <p>So yeah, … There is a lot of stuff i want to learn, and
                I’m fully aware that i wont be able to learn it all, that
                being said, the above to do list covers a decent amount of
                what i aim to learn.</p>
            <p>Too many things to learn, attempting to learn them all
                will yield failure and stumped progress.</p>
            <p>Which is exactly why i felt non-productive these past
                months (even years); I tried to absorb a lot of material and
                ended up not learning as much and i always felt-and still
                feel- inadequate about my not having learned some of them,
                but i could never verbalize that in a satisfactory way that
                circumvented the whole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">‘impostor
                    syndrome’</a> discussion/<em>accusation</em>.</p>
            <p>Which bring me, finally <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
                    role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, to the point of this
                post; and that is, to convince you that i am incompetent in
                a lot CS related domains.</p>
            <p>But when i say incompetent, i don’t mean it as a
                self-depreciative remark or belittlement.</p>
            <p><em>When i say that i am incompetent, i mean it
                    technically</em></p>
            <p>But then how to make people understand it
                mid-conversation, instead of having them genuflect and
                ‘reassure me’ that feeling inadequate is actually a normal
                thing and that it is proof that i am highly critical of
                myself which is a fine pointer that i am actually decently
                competent and thereby setting the entire discussion two
                steps back !</p>
            <p>When i say that i <em>feel</em> incompetent/inadequate,
                sure, tell me all of that pathetic (and frankly, completely
                useless <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>) sounding
                stuff .</p>
            <p>But when i say that i AM incompetent in the context of a
                conversation, it means just that, IN-COMPETENT <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
                    role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, basically that i am not
                knowledgable enough in the relevant technology to provide
                any decent contribution.</p>
            <p>It’s kind of frustrating that people sometime seem to not
                actually listen to what you’re telling them and instead just
                regurgitate those kind of unproductive statements.</p>
            <h2 id="just-a-semantics-issue">Just a semantics issue</h2>
            <p>Is it though ?</p>
            <p>I’ll grant you that, it certainly <em>seems</em> true
                that i can dispel the confusion immediately by explaining
                what i mean by the term, …</p>
            <p>Problem being, seeing as there are a <em>lot of cs
                    concepts/technologies/topics</em>, there are a lot of
                chances of this type of confusion.</p>
            <p>And I admit that clearing the misunderstanding is still a
                lot better than not, but I wish the default state was that
                of no misunderstanding at all.</p>
            <p>In the end, all i really want is for people to listen to
                what I am saying/read what I am writing, <em>actually
                    understand it and engage with it</em></p>
            <h2 id="avoiding-misunderstanding">Avoiding
                misunderstanding</h2>
            <p>Don’t get me wrong, it makes me feel bad and is generally
                not a good feeling to admit that i am incompetent in a
                domain, but when when i say it I’m not (generally) in the
                mind space of ‘ow look at me i feel incredibly clumsy and
                terribly ashamed about this’, so the above applies, etc.</p>
            <h1 id="my-2020-pledge">My 2020 pledge</h1>
            <p>Hard decisions must be made, and the sole observation i
                have been consistently making is that when you spread
                yourself too thin you’re not as efficient/effective.</p>
            <p>I also know that the two things i always kept wanting to
                do are making decent progress in SICP And learning the ways
                of Haskell programming, also LISP/SCHEME and such, but that
                is, to me right now, almost equivalent with making progress
                in SICP.</p>
            <p>It follows, then, that instead of trying to follow that
                many goals, it ought to be better if i chose a really small
                subset and <strong>dedicated myself to it, and only to it,
                    and actively avoided anything that is not directly linked to
                    it</strong>.</p>
            <p>I think that is easier said than done, but i shall try
                nonetheless.</p>
            <p>Looking back at that ToDo list …</p>
            <p><strong>SICP and Haskell are the most important things to
                    learn for me in 2020</strong> and i will try my best to stay
                as focused on them as i can.</p>
            <p>I am already doing this a lot, –as the date I am writing
                this (2020-01-17)– i have made decent progress in SICP.</p>
            <p>This I intend to do with Haskell and the other stuff as
                well.</p>
            <p>But i really want to try and limit all other use of
                anything else when I’m using the computer for my “leisure”
                time, at least.</p>
            <p>So, that’s it.</p>
            <p>Welcome to 2020 everyone.</p>
            <p>TL;DR :: I want to learn the ways of LISP, and i want to
                learn the ways of Haskell. I want to train my brain with
                some rigorous math exercises.</p>
            <p>And all the other goals are secondary to this.</p>
            <p>Yep, even updating my blog isn’t as important to me as
                progressing in SICP.</p>
