                Data</h1>

            <h1 id="i-finished-the-second-chapter-in-sicp">I finished
                the second chapter in SICP</h1>
            <p>Finally …</p>
            <p>This chapter was a lot of work, at the end it got a bit
                too repetitive and just a bit too much to track.</p>
            <p>I am comforted by the fact that i do not seem the only
                one to have this sort of opinion.</p>
            <p>Finally i can rest … <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Although to be clear, the educational content of this
                chapter was properly mind-blowing to me, i was just starting
                a list to enumerate the various concepts gone through but
                then i stopped because i realized that I’d be listing the
                table of contents at that point.</p>
            <p>There were points where i simply didn’t like the approach
                taken by the book however (my main gripe is with the put/get
                function in the data directed programming (sections 2.4 to
                2.5), not only was it low-key in-actionable because you
                couldn’t run the examples to get a better understanding ,
                which resulted in a host of problems like people posting
                their “solutions” without checking that they worked {SPOILER
                ALERT, most of them don’t}(as actually writing the code is
                better than passively reading it), but implementing this
                entire operations-type table is completely do-able, I’ve
                done just that!</p>
            <p>So i don’t really know why they went and introduced this
                weird <em>mutable</em> thing that sticks out like a sore
                thumb and ruins the way you reason about the program …</p>
            <p>But either way, the concepts were neat, and if only for
                providing more concrete feedback on why i thought the
                material in sections 2.4 and 2.5 was wonderful is that it
                explains in easy terms how remote things like data dispatch
                nd type casting can be achieved using rather easy to
                understand constructs.</p>
            <p>I am under no illusion that this is exactly how type
                coercion works for instance, the same way i am under no
                illusion that the number used in programming languages are
                built up using church encoding, but it does explain how they
                can be achieved using basic components which is the entire
                point as i understand it.</p>
            <p>Anyways, the last exercise doesn’t work, i think I’m not
                going to spend much time with this any longer as it just
                isn’t worth the trouble anymore.</p>
            <p>Maybe I’ll get back to it way later after i finish the
                book, but most likely I’ll just skip it and return to it
                independently sometime in the far future.</p>
            <p>I’m just tired of my insistence on doing all of the
                exercises, hope i get better with this obsessive compulsive
                behavior.</p>
            <p>EDIT : on 2020-01-25 i already started SICP chapter 3
                lol.</p>
