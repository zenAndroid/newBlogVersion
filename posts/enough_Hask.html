    initial commit</code></pre>
            <p>As you can see from my git log, I started my Haskell trek
                on the first of April, just as promised <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
                    role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
            <p>The Haskell book is interesting, also a bit long, which
                is good as far as I’m concerned, cause that means it goes
                into great detail, (better than LYAH in that regard), but
                sometimes it feels a bit blo-</p>
            <p>Though I guess this isn’t a review post, so I won’t go
                into that.</p>
            <p>Anyways, my progress was somewhat steady through the
                basics, actually the first parts of the book were kind of
                easy because it mostly talked about general concepts of
                functional programming, which I was a bit comfortable with,
                it got a bit more interesting as it got to datatypes and
                such, so that was nice, then the thing with kinds, which I
                didn’t get the point of until the book started explaining
                the Functor, Applicative, Monad and so on.</p>
            <p>The copy of the book I had was the 2016 one I think so
                the usage of cabal and the entire chapter on testing and
                making projects on Haskell was extremely tedious but still a
                bit instructional i guess.</p>
            <p>I think I have a lot more to say, but for now, I’ll just
                say that I stopped at Traversable, although I did read a bit
                of Reader and yet didn’t do the Chapter exercises. (for
                Reader)</p>
            <p>Well, now I am faced with a couple of options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Math.</li>
                <li>Skip the last part of the fourth SICP chapter, ans start
                    working on the fifth.</li>
                <li>Try getting into creative writing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And I am thinking that way forward is probably going to
                be a mix of them.</p>
            <p>Also, I want to say that in middle-march/beginning April
                I wasn’t as efficient as I would have hoped, but there were
                … Extenuating circumstances shall we say.</p>
            <h2 id="math">Math</h2>
            <p>God I miss that enthralling feeling when you struggle
                with a mathematical exercise for a while before finally
                finding the solution to the problem and I think it is high
                time I go back to flexing that mathematical
                muscle/rebuilding those neural pathways again.</p>
            <p>The plan I think is probably going to be mostly using
                some textbooks I adored from my high school days to get back
                to that level at least, these textbooks include some very
                interesting, <em>integrative</em> exercises that I always
                found illuminating, so hopefully they help out.</p>
            <p>Of course, the first thing I’m going to be focusing on is
                Calculus, god I loved that subject, even though I’m actually
                kind of intimidated somewhat, but I believe that I’ll get
                over it refreshing my mind.</p>
            <p>I will try to refresh my mind on as much topics I can,
                but the ones that come to mind immediately have to be
                complex numbers, calculus, linear algebra.</p>
            <p>For <em>some</em> reason, probability theory isn’t on my
                immediate to do list ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, even though I imagine I’ll
                use it a lot if I want to learn about quantum
                mechanics/quantum computing, which I want, by the way.</p>

                Register machines</h2>
            <p>The later parts of the fourth chapter of SICP still elude
                me I think, … The double continuation of the
                non-deterministic evaluator is still somewhat confusing and
                while I did trace a (kind of) execution I still don’t think
                I intuitively grasp it, as for the logic programming
                section, I completely burned out at that time and just
                blanked on the material, maybe now if I go back to it I
                might understand some more, but I can’t hide the fact that
                I’m <em>extremely</em> excited to work through the fifth
                chapter.</p>
            <p>Now that I am thinking about it. Let me see if I can find
                a summary of what is in store.</p>
            <p><strong>From Stack Overflow:</strong></p>
            <p>Chapter 5 makes a rough model of ‘register machines’, to
                represent your current day computer at an abstract level.
                They construct a little register machine language that acts
                as an assembly-language for all intents and purpose. They
                introduce all the datastructures and control flow constructs
                needed to do the next bit: building a scheme interpreter in
                this machine language. Somehow still similar to the
                meta-circular interpreter. Afterwards they jump off the deep
                end and construct a scheme compiler in their register
                machine language; complete with assembly step,
                tail-recursion optimization, garbage-collection, lexical
                addressing, tracing, etc.</p>
            <p><strong><em>OK WELL I AM DEFINITELY
                        INTERESTED</em></strong></p>
            <h2 id="creative-writing">Creative writing</h2>
            <p>This is a bit of a stretch maybe, but I want to get into
                creative writing, I do have some stories in mind, and I will
                be trying to outline and see if I can write some.</p>
