            <h1 id="posttitle">Taking a time out</h1>

            <p>Hello, I havent updated this blog in a while.</p>
            <p>But that was compeletely intentional.</p>
            <p>Well, the plan (at first) was, after resuming my SICP
                trek, to comment on the book as I read through it, but when
                I started, I quickly realized that making a blog post for
                every interesting idea would undermine my promise to myself
                by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Extending the duration of the reading of the book.</li>
                <li>Distracting me from the content of the book, such that
                    the context switching time would be too long to be worth the
                    trouble.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, going through the book and not actually thinking
                about the topics at hand felt like a waste of learning
                material, so I did the next best thing, which is to try and
                document my solutions very well, and to commit often and on
                all filesaves such that not only I’d have a github
                repository in the end that contained the <em>final</em>
                answers, but also the intermediate failing attempts so I
                could at least know what I did wrong.</p>
            <p>I tried my best to abide by this, I think its a good
                thought, but it didn’t work very well. Because I’d find a
                mistake and quickly try something else iteratively until
                something worked amnd then I would push the answer to
                github.</p>
            <p>Still, sometimes I did respect this convention. And even
                when I didn’t, I made sure to document my solution
                adequately.</p>
            <p>All of this will help me in producing a final review for
                the <em>absolute masterpiece</em> that is this book.</p>
            <p>And I did think quite a bit about the idea I laid out in
                one of my earlier posts (Fleeting ideas), my conclusion is
                that it is probably going to be feasible given that I am
                helping myself by doing well documented solution and
                <del>sometimes</del> well documented, but I am also looking
                at some neat way to animate some things to see if I can get
                some pointes across better, but this still remains an idea
                that I am not investing much in.
            </p>
            <h1 id="time-out">Time out</h1>
            <p>However, I am a bit tired of SICP for now, and I think I
                would benefit quite a bit from a swift perspective
                change.</p>
            <p>Let my subconscious do a bit of work, hopefully next time
                I resume the book, I have a bit better understanding of some
                concepts.</p>
            <h1 id="very-brief-review-of-previous-content">Very brief
                review of previous content</h1>
            <p>Since I didn’t leave much blog post at all really(except
                for commenting on the environment model) I will now say a
                very <em>VERY</em> brief one liner to summarize my thoughts
                so far about this book.</p>
            <p>Very good, streams are elegant, the first
                meta-circular-evaluator blew my mind because you basically
                implemented the material from the environment-model of
                evaluation, and there is something beautiful about building
                the evaluator and testing it out and knowing exactly what
                happens under the hood.</p>
            <p>Still find the stratified design strategy dubious, and
                the structure of the fourth chapter is weird.</p>
            <p>It was wonderful, some of the exercices were extremely
                difficult(?), I still struggle with <em>grokking</em>
                exactly how the amb evaluator works, I really had my eyes on
                that back-ward compatible lazy scheme, and I KNOW I’m going
                to do that exercice sometime, but I’ll leave it for
                later.</p>
            <h1 id="next-steps">Next steps</h1>
            <p>So, I am taking a break from SICP, what will I replace it
                with you ask? Well, as per my new years promise, Haskell of
                course!</p>
            <p>Haskell programming from First Principles. here I
                come.</p>
