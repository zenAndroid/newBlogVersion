            <p>This blog post (and general series of SICP posts) is
                dedicated in part to Zorua, in part to the future form of
                me, and in final part to you, <strong>the spirit that is
                    residing inside the computer.</strong></p>
            <p>As you probably know if you've been reading my latest
                posts, I have just started chapter 3 of SICP, the chapter
                that talks about Mutation, States, and Objects (astute
                readers will notice that, indeed, that is the title of the
                chapter), and while i can't really say I'm that advanced in
                it (as i speak, the last exercise i “finished” (In quotes
                because there are still some cases my solution can't handle
                <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>) was 3.18.
            </p>
            <p>I can of course go and try working on it some more until
                i get the general solution (the correct solution, to be
                fair), but i spent almost all day on it <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
                    role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, and i legitimately
                couldn't think of a complete solution to it, so i simply
                decided to give myself a break (also since i want to avoid
                the trap i had with section 2.4 and 2.5; Staying essentially
                stuck in one place without the ability to advance because of
                my obsessive compulsive behavior regarding trying to
                complete the exercises SEQUENTIALLY, which i always realize
                was a complete misuse of my time <em>IN HINDSIGHT</em>)</p>
            <p><strong><em>Anyways …</em></strong>, so, about SICP.</p>
            <p>I love SICP. <em>(So far)</em></p>
            <p>And i see a lot of people that share this sentiment.</p>
            <p>However, I don't feel that this feeling is communicated
                clearly in the popular reviews i see about SICP.</p>
            <p>I won't say much about this since i feel like I've
                already said enough, TL;DR : A lot of it i feel is not
                specific enough and too vague to produce any sort of cool
                and crisp mental image of the content of the book for the
                other person you're trying to communicate with.</p>
            <p>Without further ado, some of the reasons i find SICP very
                nice :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Does not teach the 'how' of computer science, teaches
                    you the 'why'.</li>
                <li>Meaty.</li>
                <li>Assumes the best in the reader.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1 id="why-though">Why though ?</h1>
            <p>The impetus for writing this post was my reaction to <a
                    href="https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/3_002e2.xhtml#g_t3_002e2">Section
                    3.2</a>, because i first read it and had the mild reaction
                of 'huh, okay neat', but as i started doing the exercises
                they kind of showed that i only skimmed the text and did not
                <em>grok</em> the content, and i had to think about it
                really hard to figure it out, then i had an 'AHA moment'
                that just makes me love the experience of reading this
                book.
            </p>
            <p>What is this 'AHA' moment you ask? Well, for me, it boils
                down to this: Even though SICP might not revolutionize
                computer science and bring about new concepts to the field,
                it <em>does revolutionize the way you look</em> at computer
                programs and computer science in general, because it does
                not tell you, for instance, how type systems work and how
                you can conceptualize inheritance or something to that
                effect, it shows how these things come naturally by
                <em>having you build the system from the ground up</em>, and
                you come out of it having a deeper understanding of how it
                might be implemented in “real world” scenarios.
            </p>
            <p>That's just one example in the end of chapter 2 by the
                way, and it seems that there's still a lot where that came
                from.</p>
            <p>You can go ahead and read <a
                    href="https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/3_002e2.xhtml#g_t3_002e2">Section
                    3.2</a>, and see if you gain anything from it, personally,
                what i gained was a clear understanding of how environments
                can shadow other environments and how its possible to model
                variable/name shadowing in a language, read that sentence
                again, this is what i talked about when i meant that my
                first reaction to it was a somewhat tame 'huh, okay neat',
                but when I thought about it, this meant that i could start
                imagining how: - to implement this whole environement
                business - the interpreter “knows” the difference between a
                variable and a procedure (by checking if its simply pointing
                to a raw value, or by checking if its pointing to the
                special construct of &lt;procedure-info,
                enclosing-environment-pointer&gt;), how any procedure
                evaluation happens (the formal parameter gets substituted
                for the actual parameter in the procedure's body, and that
                is evaluated normally), how a local variable shadows global
                ones, and many other goodies.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>I am under no illusion that this is exactly how type
                    coercion works for instance, the same way i am under no
                    illusion that the number used in programming languages are
                    built up using church encoding, but it does explain how they
                    can be achieved using basic components which is the entire
                    point as i understand it.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>It does not teach you how to implement language feature X
                in your coding habits and exploit it to the max.</p>
            <p>Rather, it <del>tells</del>
                <strong><em>shows</em></strong> you <em>why</em> you need
                language feature X in your coding habits and while doing it,
                naturally shows you how to do so.

            <p>I saw a bunch of reviews, most of them i liked and agreed
                with, but i always wondered: “Why aren't they citing
                concrete examples from the book, surely the reviewer's point
                will become clearer if they show which section lead them to
                this conclusion?” and that was my initial intent as well
                when planning my reviews, but then you soon come to a
                realization …</p>
            <h1 id="meaty-this-book-has-no-filler">Meaty: This book has
                no filler</h1>
            <p>Every chapter is necessary, every subsection is crucial,
                every paragraph makes you think, there is no easy way to
                compress the information held within the content … So if you
                are an optimistic reviewer looking to show people why you
                think sicp is neat by going through a <em>truly</em> <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
                    role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> exhaustive list of
                reasons, then you can only claim you've rewritten SICP in
                its entirety, which, at that point, you're back at square
                one, if they weren't going to read SICP, what makes you
                think they'll read your version of it ?</p>
            <p>But i will try to formulate a sensibly detailed review of
                what i appreciated in SICP, I will try …</p>
            <h1 id="assuming-the-best">Assuming the best</h1>
            <p>Reading SICP is good.</p>
            <p><em>Skimming</em> SICP is
                <strong><em>BAD</em></strong>.
            </p>
            <p>The exercises are the true soul of the book, I simply
                <em>cannot</em> imagine someone going through the entire
                book without struggling with the exercise and learning
                much.
            </p>
            <p>And it has quite a decent amount of exercises too, … And
                the difficulty curve isn't exactly … Predictable either. <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
                    role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
            <p>For instance (trying to keep the non-exhaustiveness
                promise in mind). In chapter 1 you go form basically nothing
                to implementing a basic version of newton's method of
                calculating square roots and cube roots, to then use higher
                order procedures to abstract over the past examples to
                implementing <em>nth-root</em> methods, and essentially
                finding the roots of any equation using the binary search
                methodology, delving in the deep end of recursion and
                Fibonacci method, optimizing that further using
                tail-call-optimization, then jumping to prime number
                detection, implementing a <em>beautiful</em> probabilistic
                method to detect prime numbers <em>in a logarithmic number
                    of steps</em>, and so many other things this blog post is
                too small to contain …</p>
            <p>… Like the fact that it has you <em>prove</em> some facts
                about <em>phi</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">the golden
                    ratio</a>, and it has you write the definition of the
                tangent function and Euler's number in their continued
                fraction form and its <em>fucking glorious</em>.</p>
            <p>And that's just the <em>first chapter</em>.</p>
            <p>Then the second chapter comes and … It brings its own set
                of mind blowing concepts …</p>
            <p>Like introducing the very important pair construct in
                lisps (<code>cons</code> and its natural extension
                <code>list</code>), and the use of that as a building block
                to create interesting things, they emphasize that everything
                that the outer systems have to see are abstract selectors
                that can be used without knowing the implementation details
                <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, then the next
                section
                talks about having means of combination that allow for
                closures on types that are incredibly powerful tools for
                expressing more advanced ideas (TL;DR closure property means
                having a way to perform an operation on an object (or a set
                of objects) <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> and
                getting an object of
                the same type), introducing the concept of mappings and
                accumulation, <em>IMMEDIATELY</em> shoving the reader down
                the deep end and telling them to implement <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method">Horner's
                    method</a> using accumulations, then <em>IMMEDIATELY</em>
                combining these concepts (mappings and accumulations) to
                make you implement basic linear algebra operations (namely
                dot-product, vectorXmatrix, matrixXmatrix, and
                matrix-transpose), then another beautiful concept is
                introduced with the concept of nested mapping.
            </p>
            <p>If you thought nested for loops are hard to come by in
                functional programming, think again, because each for loop
                body can be put in a one to one correspondence with a
                mapping. The new thing i should have realized is that
                mapping
                <code>(lambda(i) &lt;loop-body&gt; (sequence 1 n))</code> is
                sufficient to model the index, that helped put things in
                more equal footing in my mind.
            </p>
            <p>And then, just in case you needed a “more” practical
                example, there is a Picture Language example that shows the
                beauty of the Closure property.</p>
            <p>And no, chapter 2 still has a lot of goodies to offer,
                set representations and operations on sets, a basic
                implementation of a symbolic differentiator, a truck-load of
                examples about Huffman encoding, a very Out OF Character
                exercise where SICP asks you to encode the lyrics of a rock
                song with very interesting lyrics.</p>
            <p>And finally, we close on Chapter 2 and let it rest,
                because there is no way it'll add something more it didn't
                add before …</p>
            <p>Well that was a scheming lie, because you see, chapter 2
                still has a final mind blow to deliver in section 2.4 and
                2.5 and it comes when you implement a generic arithmetic
                system, with multiple types of data and generic operations
                that work across different types, making it so by following
                the exercises you have the power to represent polynomials
                whose coefficients are either complex numbers, regular
                numbers, rational number, or … Polynomials themselves, and
                also the generic operations can work on multiple types as
                long as you design the corresponding type casters :)</p>
            <p>The final extended exercise for chapter 2 is adding
                rational functions to the system .. And its about as amazing
                as it sounds.</p>
            <p>That is the end of chapter 2, then there's chapter 3,
                which I am reading now.</p>
            <h1 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h1>
            <p>SICP is pretty cool.</p>
