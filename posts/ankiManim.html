            <h1 id="posttitle">The title of this post</h1>
            <p>I have recently acquired a new tool in my arsenal that I
            hope will help me learn things more effectively and
            efficiently.</p>
            <p>I shall discuss it now.</p>
            <h1 id="anki-and-spaced-repetition">Anki and spaced
            repetition</h1>
            <p>Actually I won’t waste both of our times by trying to
            describe it.</p>
            <p>Wikipedia or other places do a better job than me so if
            you are curious you should read that.</p>
            <p>But if I were to describe the core idea for why I was
            attracted to Anki, it would go something like:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Imagine a note-taking system that collects all of your
            individual notes, shows you each one and gives you the
            opportunity to rank each one depending on how easy you
            recollected it, and then schedules the next time you will
            review the notes so that you don’t waste time reviwing notes
            you can easily recollect.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>That is not an explanation of what Anki is about, merely
            <em>what initially drew me to it</em>, so there is actually
            a lot more to be said and a lot of other amazing concepts
            within.</p>
            <p>There is a nice summarizing image that explains the
            usefulness and effect of repeated testing:</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="../assets/images/misc/Ebbinghaus_repeat.png"
            alt="Forgetting curve" />
            <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Forgetting curve</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I don’t really think that image needs any explanation, it
            speaks for itself.</p>
            <p>This gradual increase in decay time underlies the design
            of Anki and similar memory systems. It’s why Anki gradually
            expands the time periods between testing.</p>
            <p><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve">This
            is interesting reading, by the way</a>.</p>
            <p><a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">This is
            also interesting reading</a>.</p>
            <p>I want to stress that you should read that last article
            atleast, because no matter what you are doing right this
            instant, if you have never encountered this concept of
            spaced repetition before, <strong><em>This is 100% worth the
            time</em></strong>, so, just .. read it.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukLnPbIffxE">You
            should also watch this first part of a video on
            Evidence-Based revision tips</a>, <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zNHHpXoMM">the one
            we’re interested in is in part 2, where Ali talks about
            spaced repetition.</a></p>
            <p>My other interest I suppose is none other than …</p>
            <h1
            id="manim-the-mathematical-animation-engine"><strong>Manim,
            the mathematical animation engine</strong></h1>
            <figure>
            <img src="../assets/images/misc/Manim-logo.png"
            alt="Manim" />
            <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Manim</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I’ve had my eyes on Manim, the mathematical animation
            engine developed by Grant Sanderson, also known as <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw">3Blue1Brown</a>
            for quite a while now, the reasons are two-fold, one, I was
            just absolutely curious and wanted to try and see if I could
            make my own animations/creations, two, see if I can modify it or even <em>use</em>
            some of its components to create fitting constructs to help
            me animate solutions or such.</p>
            <p>Didn’t really think much on what constructs I would need
            in particular, since I don’t want to fall into my tunnel
            vision, and I know how easy it would be to fall into that,
            AND I know just how “productive” I can be when I’m
            paralyzed, so I will look back at this question later with a
            better stance (hopefully) after I’ve seen what I can do with
            the engine.</p>
            <h1 id="for-now">For now …</h1>
            <p>For now I shall attempt increasing my math fluency and
            maybe I’ll pick up SICP tomorrow or something.</p>
